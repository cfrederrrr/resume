## Objective
Technology Operations oriented Engineering position

## About
To speak of myself as an automation minded engineer is an incomplete assertion. This quote stuck out to me as it succinctly sums up one of my strongest held beliefs about life as an operations engineer:

>Improving daily work is even more important than doing daily work.<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; ~ Gene Kim, KevinBehr, George Spafford; _The Phoenix Project_

To me, this means getting better at tasks means that performing them becomes trivial; thus it is more important to focus on improving, and the rest will come naturally.

As I see it, if I should have to do something more than once, a machine should do it the second time and every time thereafter. Except of course, at the cost of security or feature/service delivery.

A tirelessly analytical nature and voraciously curiosity are the best tools at my disposal in the service of my broad goal to improve as an engineer... but knowing a lot of Bash, Ruby and Powershell doesn't hurt.
